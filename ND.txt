In addition to this, the model of a smarter university
assumes the existence of an efficient university administration open to continuous changes. This is a real critical
point across multiple university systems. Each university
should be able to control all its parts from a “ single virtual
automated room” , thank s to analytic and forecasting platforms that should help in managing the risks, the financial
exposures, and anything else. A few initial experiments
that support our vision have been set in place by some
universities that attempt to be smarter. The results are
encouraging. For example, the University of California has
developed a risk management system that involves 10
campuses and 5 medical universities. By forecasting,
managing and scheduling the risk s, and by using simulations of activities, the participating universities have
reduced by 39% their expenses, and reduced the insurance
costs by 167 million dollars since 20 0 6. North Carolina
State University uses a cloud computing system to manage
all the 250,0 0 0 students belonging to the entire educational system of the state public schools, including colleges
and universities. This offers to the state of North Carolina
and to the university system a considerable savings in
terms of cost of infrastructures
